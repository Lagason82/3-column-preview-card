## My process

- centering the wrapper for one card first
- add all the structure css
- add all the property to custom elements
- copy the completed template card and reinsert the content for second and third card.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- importing face font, with previous project, I have added custome using link rel, and then I learned how to import fonts from local in the css section, and now , importing using url in the css area.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Big+Shoulders:opsz,wght@10..72,100..900&family=Lexend+Deca:wght@100..900&display=swap');

```

### Continued development

- continue with familiarizing css html through project/challenges.
